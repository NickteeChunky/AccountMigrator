# AccountMigrator
Migrates PocketMine-MP account data upon changing Xbox Live usernames.

### What does it do?
This plugin stores player data using XUID (Xbox user ID) instead of usernames which can come in handy for players who change their Xbox account usernames and don't want to lose essential player data that PMMP stores (ex: inventory, experience, ender chest, etc.)

### DISCLAIMER
This plugin has not been thoroughly tested, submit an issue if you run into any problems.
